Wakes your brain up!
The location is perfect with Marais being a great area to stay in with restaurants, shops, cafes, bars and the metro all close by.
Despite the noise and bustle outside, the rooms are very quiet, and we overlooked Las Ramblas.
We travel often and usually stay at very nice hotels.
This was so bad experience that i wouln't stay again in this hotel.
So fast.
I am unsure as to whether or not the creators are also reading private dms.
FC5CBFO, on checking this out all antiviruses say the same thing about this program.
The room was clean, quite, black out windows for siesta.
This downloader is great.
When you take some time using it you realize it is a great video editing.
All manner of conveniences are available ""barring"" a mini-bar (pun intended :) ).
Basically, it's an ok planner.
Takes my mind notes visually and understandable.
Very disappointing.
Nice breakfast, complimentary mini bar in room, safe for your belongings, toiletries.
Even the accessories in the app look fake.
I don't what Microsoft was thinking with this update but I don't like it either way~
To much muscito's.
Can't find anything on oracle about windows 2000 not being supported and this page lists windows 2000 as supported, but the x86 downloads for jre7 all result in not a valid win32 application messages.
I would liked a complete bathroom with the wash basin in the same room.
Brilliant for Energy Assessors to compile photo evidence for audits.
Breakfast is just soso.
Feature-Packed
the breakfast was really good and the view and walking facilities for the dog in the grounds were terrific.
When you phone the staff say parking is around the corner.
The wether as you understand in Russia was extremely cold, but the heating system was extra hot and we couldn't control it at all.
THERE ARE NO CHEATERS ON THAT GAME OR HACKERS
The hotel is very nice, modern, clean.
There were 4 responsible during our visit;but this lady gave us our room earlier than check-in time;but she was very rude and her attitudes were very bad..
Being a new Apple Developer, I needed a fast program that would work fast and has a easy User Interface.
Won't recommend it to anyone.
excited
Reserved a suite for four nights and requested a room on a higher floor with a view of the square in front.
The people who gave it 5 or 4 or 3 or 2 stars.
When checking out, they even put wrong charge from other room onto our bill, wasting our time, 30 mins,for waiting them to check and revise the bill, sooooooo slow.
Full of ads!
This is good.
Feels like Skype hired the same person who ruined hangout :/
Bedroom excellent,staff impeccable,the manager on the night we stayed was a man called [NAME] who was the friendliest manager iv ever know,very nice place very nice people.
I went to another hotel down the road who still had an open restaurant.
Wonderful staff at breakfast nothing too much trouble.
And All-Inclusive choice could be good.
Free wifi is compromised and actually blacklisted on 3 counts on IP information site.
But seriously, this game is cool.
This hotel has so much to offer and is brilliantly located for all of the hot spots in Barcelona.
The staff was better than fantastic.
Please make it stop.
This is a really fun game to play in your spare time.
Most of the people I know have this game downloaded to their phone, tablet, or computer.
Just awesome.
The Daum Pot Player has the potential to be a very good video player.
Listen to the people who gave it 1 star.
It was great.
Beyond thrilled and thoroughly addicted!
Hotel very nice and staff very helpful and friendly.
I loaded it onto my Windows 7 machine and hide a store of files.
This hotel is gorgeous and pretty spacious.
A bit misleading, I thought I was booking a hotel for $389.00 everything in.....then it said $453.00 taxes & hotel fees!
Have stayed here a couple of times and each time it's been perfect!
Having the wash basin in the room made it a little difficult.
Totally free and totally worth it.
Spring Spa Escape was fantastic value.
Hotel was one of our favorites.
The rooftop pool is amazing.
Our room was on the upper floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower.
The room had issues with cleanliness, and maintenance.
We also walked further down to the Zocalo and to the cathedral.
even if they are planning to renovate the old section in the near future, it would be nice if they kept up with simple maintenance issues - like replacing the missing tiles from the stairs etc..
The best game boy ever
Limited options
We couldn't have been happier with the hotel.
Wow, this hotel is top notch and it's location in the Gothic Quarter is great.
Although I do kind've dislike the fact on how you have to put your actual face on here.
The Corner Hotel has a beautiful aesthetic.
There wasn't any program in the late evening
this place is different!
Helpful staff and mini fridge in the room stocked with sofa, juice and water.
The slow service and understanding appears to be a ""thing"" among the Balenese people.
If I want to use the bloody Snapchat I'll download that on my phone.
Rte is essentially a quango and this is the product of an over fattened civil servant pig.
Air Con when it works does not suit all people.
Also I think it needs more hairstyles I have ombre hair that should be an option.
Plus, lots of graphical lag when trying to show new messages.
Great room and shower.
Old, but stable game.
Phone froze as if the app had a virus.
These issues need to be resolved.
Worked fast and excellently on a number of jpegs for emailing purposes, reduced file size by 98% with no loss of readability.
Upgrade to a suite - it's so worth the extra luxury.
* Very dull output picture Quality.
only complaint is it drains the battery pretty fast, but all app games drain the battery.
Many thanks to the wonderful staff at the hotel but especially [name] and his colleague [name] who did everything to ensure we were well informed about Paris.
Thanks!
We ordered three of the same thing from the menu we were given but the server delivered something totally different.
Works straight out of the box
When you order something in the restaurant it takes long time to get it and they always miss something.
A charming hotel in a peaceful part of the city, yet many shops, restaurants and coffee shops close by.
The same thing happened the next morning.
THe Demo is only one hour!
This chain overbooked for our stay so we arrived at a sister hotel after 8 hours on the road to be told we were bumped to another nearby.
One of our good friends was staying a few doors down from us and received a plate of macarons on their first night and each consecutive night after.
The room was facing an inner garden, facing windows of other rooms, it could have been anywhere, not mentioned at booking.
It is one of the best hotels that I have encountered.
The room was very small but the way it is furnished creates so much space for everything.
i think is sow cool
A dont have original program, but number 17 is inafe good and more then everybody need.
Friendly Staff, Comfortable room, excellent breakfast.
i think the google earth is wonderful!
It is a huge step into the past, it isn't good at all.
I was really impressed with this hotel.
The restaurant is a true dining experience - outstanding food and service.
install this and windows 10 will update it to a newer version
I have to see them individually.
I liked the staff, they were very friendly and helpful.
I don't want to see ""Translate from hindi"" in the bottom as suggestion when I'm translating from Marathi.
You will face awful dirt and noise everywhere they are.
Great hotel and fantastic staff.
We would definitely stay there again!
Bedroom was big and bed very comfortable.
We enjoy the view from our suite, very clean and excellent organized.
5 stars!
Piano Tiles 2 is a great game, really fun to play and you won't find yourself deleting it after only a few days or weeks.
if there any updates?
It was not very clean,strong smell of paint on the third floor, and had to access third floor from second floor up stairs because of ongoing reovations.
But it did not!
awesome app
Water pressure of the shower is weak.
Instagram doesn't remember the Facebook share settings.
It is having a huge impact on comfort in this generally good hotel
I can't stop playing this game even my little brother plays it and he is 5 years old.
We enjoyed our stay very much.
A high price for guests to access pool facilities, we just wanted a quick dip, not an afternoon spa experience.
Water in shower smelt, the pool on the beach was closed and thats why we chose the resort but we didn't find this information out until we arrived - very very disappointed with that as wouldn't have stayed there if we knew that was the case.
Cons:
The room was located at the end of a very long hall and the mattress was extremely uncomfortable.
Htc sync is a bad problem for htc owners.
New smileys look so flat and boring.
Restaurant - breakfast - very simple bufet, the worst coffe we ever drink, poor staff in the restaurant
I also like the different things you can use to send to friends.
Nothing
They don t have parking
It will on ly vug you to the limits of your time.
It has become rather addicting for my mother and I and we can never get enough of it.
I play the classics on this game more than I do on my actual piano!
Beautifully crafted resort.
The staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive.
We held welcome drinks at the pool bar the night before our wedding.
loved using it
1. Service Tax = 12% of amount
We spent the last 3 days of our vacation in Barcelona.
I finally got the game in win 8.1. I like this game very much.
No mouse control.
The hotel was clean, well managed, conveniently located and the staff was outstanding.
The twin room was small in size, perfect for 1or2 night stay.
As the men have more things that appeal to girls.
how can it be solved???
Very helpful.
The rooms are very modern and cool with all the amenities you expect from this level of hotel.
The installing process was quite complicated.
Residents had to eat breakfast in the restaurant and couldn't sit outside on the square.
Ocean wasn't good for swimming
Does not do what it claims to do.
Spent a long time selecting the right hotel for a 3 night break to Barcelona.
it is so wonderful to use
I do not know who is on-line and who is not, if I am on the contact list.
I loved the big sink and mirror in the bathroom and the spaciousness of the room.
It was sheer chaos when I arrived.
Not good.
Couldn't fault the place!
It is impossible to give this hotel the reviews it deserves in words.
Teracopy really rocks and works well with Windows Explorer, but does not seem to work with v8.5
Great service, great views, the rooms were clean and comfortable.
We stayed here for 2nights when we visited Barcelona, what a great hotel!
Thank you hotel Imperial!!!!!!!
other than that its a realllly cool app
Not cool, so bad review so their marketing team thinks about it.
No errors.
I'd give it a minus if I could.
I was told on the site that u don't pay til check in (like before) and two days later the entire amount of$251.37 was taken from my bank card.
room was nice and big and comfortable
it bis so helpful for find Age .
ah software ke throuhg maine apna keemti data recovr kiya hai
Its a lovely place made even more memorable by an excellent team of staff.
I love my Songbird & listen to
2. It's nothing but it consumes a large amount a CPU and memory.
an unexpected error has occured.
Unless one of them DIES (rip lightbulb you will be missed ;-; )
Very low level of service.
Then started to ramble on about the the hotel architecture.
it's a boutique hotel,
is literally the WORST web browser that I have ever used in my entire life.
Really good palyer.
You can get a lot of different registry correcting software, but this one really fixes the problems and you don't have to worry about it damaging your system unlike other software.
It has several settings to uninstall and scan for unnecessary and excess files and other useless files, folders etc.
Clean!
Only restriction applies to t-shirts with alcohol brands.
Five star prices but that's about it.
We would highly recommend this Hotel.
Good triple rooms, comfy beds and plenty of space.
I would say that the parking area is a little too far, since we brought a private car with no driver.
Also the themes should at least have one that was similar to the previous blue and grey look.
I am FURIOUS!
easy to use
it has solved a huge problem to me .
Nobody proposed anything how to solve my problem.
Anybody have any ideas how to fix this problem.
We absolutely loved our stay at the Saint James, Paris.
Very warm welcome at the reception by Valentin.
[name] went out of her way to help us.
The one weights machine was only partly working.
game is good
Looks just the pictures with two patio doors and balcony.
rooms were clean and big.
Stayed at a very bad hotel that was a dump recently.
#NAME?
This is a lovely gem of a small boutique hotel.
Good and faster.
Hello everyone I used VanBasco Karaoke Player on my previous laptop under window XP
My husband talked to one of the staff at the front desk to see if they would have any luck getting through to the restaurant.
Beds most comfortable thing ever
Discount codes and deals absolutly never work.
Repaintet room and new tiles in the bathroom.
the charcter
I only have one complaint, which is the lack of any modern songs.
audio and video is good
I had to pull out the battery and restart.
I was surprised to see a separate gluten-free section in the buffet area of the diningroom for breakfast - there was a good selection of cereals, bread,
It's a perfect location for exploring the vibrant neighborhood, as well as the Notre Dame, Louvre, etc.
The curtain of the bathroom had some marks that we didn't like to touch.
This is a warning about Camfrog
I wish Booking wouldn't represent certain hotels.
The room was swell with a mini fridge, excellent bathroom with molten brown products, yummy breakfasts included, great location, nice roof top area.
Otherwise very happy and continue to use it.
Very simple to use.
I have stayed at many boutique hotels and this one went above and beyond in terms of service.
Huge Ryanair fan and 9 times out of 10 they are the cheapest but cmon!
I've analyzed the the Sonic Games program file with virustotal.com,and the final score was 0/41. That means a 0% presence of viruses, trojans or any other threat in this file.
We could not have stayed at a nicer hotel in Paris.
This hotel was the perfect location to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and was lovely to come back to after a day out exploring.
You don't need to spend money, and you can play it at your own pace.
Extraordinary choices, i always want more.
yes i want to test , it's look funny!!
Nothing
By far the best efective filter for web that I used.
They couldn't understand anything we were asking.
If the hotel transport to and from airport can be provided for free than the flow of the trip would have been much better.
But there is one limitation for users like India.
This room was booked at the last minute due to having to leave our previous hotel early due to unsuitability.
program i like create game like a hl2,portal 2,lf4d2,hl and
realy good
A beautiful river runs by near the location.
Very very nice program
Stayed here this month before a cruise.
I really hate the new version!
The new Skype update, to summarize, is a major setback, and does indeed provide features the original didn't have, but it shouldn't be an issue to keep the prior version and add in new aspects.
wow wow wow wow wow wow
Nothing
Your real IP is leaked on HTTPS sites without you knowing.
We had a great four night stay at la Chambre du Marais.
Bed was very comfy.
I was supposed to receive it by 04/24/17 which was later changed to 05/03/17. So I contacted support letting them know before May 3rd that i moved and that my package was still was not there even after checking after May 3rd.
There is also a castle that you can hike to.
The style of the hotel is very pretty in a chic kind of way.
This app is not good.
Located in a beautiful residential arrondissement in walking distance to L'Arc de Triumphe.
Plus the videos don't load until we restart the app
Doesn't see my phone - cant do anything with it
I rang reception at 21:30 to notify them of the noise.
[name] (tall [name] with little hair) was so kind, friendly and helpful.
Many young generation in the entourage.
Number of good add-ons is limited
I would stay there again, it was a perfect experience.
The hotel is old and definitely in need of an upgrade, particularly given the prices charged.
Staff were wonderful.
Watching my tv shows should not be this difficult.
great app
One thing I do not like is Charizard.
I knew I was in the right place when I heard them playing it in the lobby.
I was was able to configure my HL-2240 Brother printer, and my old HP scanner was immediately recognized.
I love it!
Great place to stay on the left bank.
(saving the hazzle of dealing with local taxi company ripping people off, or having many taxi drivers harassing you when u walk out- which is our only problem for this trip.)
It is across the river and a long walk in the rain to get there and back.
Rooms were a bit pricey though.
Noisy cleaning and lot's of fumes at 5am.
Very cool personalizing your own character.
Close to a mall and food places.
We had an incredible four day stay at the Peninsula!
Over the years have stayed 20 - 30 times at this Hotel
The towel i used was stained and ragged.
Hotel was clean and food was awesome...
Can't share photos straight from the gallery app.
La Chambre du Marais is a recently renovated boutique hotel in the Marais section of Paris.
Service was appaling - absolutely not up to Sofitel standards.
it is so much easier to use my in come is thru the A.
She followed up with a call to my room to make sure everything was to my satisfaction.
It's more like a tommogatchi kind of game, where you feed and train your Magikarp to ""Battle"" or jump.
This is the only hotel we have stayed in that we had to pay for parking.
The ads that run have no video just audio, and then get stuck so I have to repeat over and over getting it to load my content.
#NAME?
The tour ended at the Barcelona Hilton, but we wanted someplace closer to the sights so we moved to the Catalonia Square.
The room was small with no view, but we didn't care as we were there to see the city.
this is the best media player because of following:
A very nice and clean hotel.
My wife and I spent three nights here after a group tour of Northern Spain.
#NAME?
There is nothing to dislike at the Oberoi.
Great location and very helpful and professional staff.
I went to uninstall it and it won't uninstall.
Everything at your doorstep.
Overall excellent.
Picture quality.
I have been using
Even a yoga class ...
Totally brilliant intuitive application.
I stayed in a Deluxe Boulevard room for 3 nights as part of a large corporate group.
The most comfortable hotel bed we have ever slept in!
The lobby doesn't exist currently, as it's under construction.
I didnt like that we were given a room in the far flung corner of the resort up on Level 3. I didnt like that the pool and restaurant on the beach was under construction (would not have booked here if I knew). I didnt like the breakfast much, pretty ordinary and the noise of the construction was a bit off putting.
I give this company credit for using pictures/images that are clear in interpretation, which makes the game much more enjoyable.
Because my account is so old, I have no way of accessing the original email address I used to opem it Now it is telling me it can't verify who I am!!!
Delightful I know.
We just returned from our 6 night stay at the Hotel Monge.
I will be sure to bookmark your blog and may come back very soon.
Plz send me this software because i forgotten it.
We mistakenly had thought we had all rooms booked for 2 nights but we only had one night booked.
Maybe old style clothing too from civil war era not just city slicker clothing
its a fabulous games
Can't complain at the Beach front location!
Thanks for that.
Very expensive for an 'ok' room.
When we ask ice water they bring either water or ice not together.
Very good software for free user..
its good
I have watched soaps on this a few times.
We stayed a couple of nights at Favart.
It was very hot in the room.
it is best app
Came to the area to visit a local Asian Festival & the Columbus Zoo.
Whatever you request they get it done.
I hope this helps u rate the game.
itworks great on skype to.
Castle Crashers was a very far fetched at first for me.
Okay, I seen people use Bitmoji and I was all like you know what I'm gonna give it a shot and yeah so it was really good and in fact maybe I can get my Bitmoji character to be friends with a unique character by EnhancedToon ""Sunny the Yellow Creature"" so yeah.
Every time you try to watch a live stream, the stream is hijacked by a mandatory unskippable advert.
All the different colors and settings satisfy me greatly.
a) It's very creative (Sandbox game) as you can move and place back almost every little object in the huge world.
Close to restaurants, hop on and off bus and the Metro.
It's free, no ads, no hidden pay-to-play content, it even limits how much money you can put into it!
really dislike it.
Jesus!
It's there and configured but won't pop up.
The location is second to none - my husband and I walked everywhere as the location was so central and in the centre of everything.
Unfortunately the bed was so hard and uncomfortable we didn't have this problem last time we stayed so maybe just unlucky with the bed in this room we got but it made sleeping very difficult.
This program is very useful!
The location was perfect - within walking distance to all the shops and restaurants.
also this is not a destination for a solo traveler.
Let's just say this game has hidden depths.
Staff is very friendly and supportive.
Did people's reviews get deleted or something when you updated the versions?
The rooms were all commodious and the staff was courteous and responsive.
and its so fun
Beautiful afternoon at the Bristol!
is great
Mzeye and has a distinct, very sweet
My husband and I choose this beautiful hotel for its location, price, and style.
Need to kwno which all programming languages i need to know to start working on Android SDK?
This app is stopping unfortunately in every 5 minutes....
nice tool!
I would love to buy and download music on my pc I do not know much about
I just wanna stay here again because it was marvelous hotel.
This is an absolutely great casual game!
We booked a King size room, at check-in we've been told King Size room are all occupied (a lie because later I realized that resort was not fully booked) and receptionist tried to bargain with us for a single beds room.
not for other games
I have a slight mobility problem and this was as comfortable and easy as it gets.
I spent a whole day trying to get my 8Gig iTouch to give up all the images I had saved from the internet.
The latest version does not allow this or there is no option.
Very awful new look and inefficient app.
Not sure why this is happening.
Waste of space
There are few pictures need to be better and make sense to the words because there are deaf people who like to play this game and it is hard for them to sound the words.
Edit: after using it for a couple of hours I've realized that it's also super slow, so that's a great update, isn't it?
Notifications button only shows People I may know NOT actual notification.
I suggest to move this programs from that part to main pool to give this possibility to all the guests to join them not just for persons .
When I select a live stream on the tv, it shows the channel selected.
But That Old Version Will Not Play The New H.264 Format,
I can't say enough about this place!
but please, PLEASE allow there to be an option to toggle the online/offline statuses back on, or SOMETHING.
Nothing, it was perfect!
The rooms are spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated.
Nothing seems to have been addressed on these matters that people have been complaining about since the app came out either.
Expensive for what you get.
This is a serious problem which the management needs to review and improve immediately.
This is poor as hotels are not cheap & paring for guests should be free.
Mga SubskripsiyonView
Also the whole room was soaking wet all the time all our clothes were wet and everything in the room we touched was soaking well the room was freezing we turned it off but it would come back on again that couldn't have been healthy for us at our age.
Bring back Invisible and Away!
Ok, it's better if you know a bit about what you're doing first, but with a bit of research and a bit of trial and error, I've been coming up with Great HD rips from Blu-Ray.
Adobe's Flash Player is so ingrained the WEB that most sites will 'flash' you a message that you don't have Flash installed.
Other than that this is a great app
This game is the best game i have everseen.
I would appreciate any kind of help.
Stunningly good.
We booked this hotel as it's part of SLH and we where never disappointed .
This is not the latest version!
Some of the filter like eye color, lipstick, hair color are very tough to apply, so a focus on that can be made ao that these filters are applied easily.
Buses full of tourists come and go.
Not enough fresh fruit on offer for breakfast nor yogurts.
This is a clean, comfortable room with good breakfast and the staff also very nice.
The rooms are modern and comfortable.
Very rude staff in the reception and not helpful when we asked for use the hotel's services.
Let us choose the default order.
feels some graphic issues..
Staff especially the Events manager where very nice
After we refuse for obvious reason, they bring in another fridge and place it on the floor as on the photo, which is truly hilarious for a 5 star resort.
Many OH &S issues accessing the beach whist construction happening!
Incompatible with ClassicShell releases, freezes continuously, has horrible graphics and it is full of bugs.
this app saves me 39 euro when i had my ticket just on my phone that mashine refuse to accept it so a one of the crew help me to download this ap and show me how can i get a completely different code and it work :D
Room a bit old.
Too MANY ADS
Works straight out of the box
its cool and awsome i love it
I didn't like we didn't get told about the front pool being closed and the restaurant.
This review doesn't tell the whole story.
- The bedroom was recommended 2 adults+2 Kids, however the bed-sofa fits just one Person - which was not informed before;
The concierge was super helpful ...
That's really pathetic cause those are the languages I want & are spoken by 100s of millions of people.
In all reality, it is a glorified version of
Every question that we had for the Concierge was answered or fulfilled immediately and without hesitation.
is amayzing :D and is really really really awsome
So, he was also limited about the good spot recommendations & overall advices.
Pool Access Room was a long walk from the lobby.
Only the fact that the beach bar & pool had started to be demolished the week before we arrived.
Steals Your money.
Hello sir i need to transfer $ 9.million us dollars to you i am chinyere sonia ayozie from sierra leone
but we loved our stay and will be back!
Not a long enough stay to see the wonderful coastal area
Once you put your info ie. shipping and billing info you dont have to do it for every order l just tap buy choose size and swipe to confirm very simple.
I only wish I would have stayed in this hotel my entire trip.
#NAME?
Being able to communicate with a person in their native language, even with imperfect grammar helps bridge the gap between parties of dissimilar origin.
When myself or my business is included in one of these posts I would love to be able to repost and credit the source without having to screenshot or screen record their original post.
Unbelievable trash!
A beautifully crafted boutique resort.
Normal game!
When it comes to the end like a minute or so until it ends it just stops with an error message giving options such as cancel or more details.
My mom and I stayed here for a week for spring break and loved it.
I use it everytime I needed to edit a photo, but now it crashes when using makeuptool.
The breakfast buffet was a great deal at 12 euros.
We are so lucky to have found the perfect second home at the heart of Paris.
Service : excellent
My husband and I stayed at Casa Camper for two nights prior to a cruise.
The Best Thing Has Always Been How You
The mattress was way too firm and the pillow had no ""bounce"" at all.
It crashed two of my hard drives.
Nearly 33 GB and only took about 70mins.
Absolutely fantastic.
It is easy to figure out how to use
Fantastic room on the 5th floor.
I have searched for so many accounting software.
The bed was hard as a rock.
This product is awesome it picks up malware in a click of a finger.
Recommend it to everyone for keeping and organizing ideas.
EDIT: I love how quickly the developers fixed the issue and the great considerate support they gave.
When you get to their site it's confusing and unclear.
Hotel policies must be reviewed to create a good ambience and not to on poor quality tourism.
Love it!!!
During off-season (now) a lot of things aren't there even if advertised.
Excelent!
Nice residential neighborhood.
Reception not very helpfull on this occasion
I really like the program, but I do have a big objection, and a second that is due to the first.
It was right in the center of Nice and close to absolutely everything.
Amazing view across the harbour from the roof terrace which has sun beds and a small plunge pool.
I felt the food quality/taste could have been better, check-in could have been better organized (took a while to find my bookings, as I had 2 separate ones.. then directed to the Club for check-in where the same thing happened! Then somehow it was reflected I didn't turn up for my booking so I was told I needed to be charged after I left)
Also it keeps making itself default browser.
Its the bt game in the world/Beer than all GTA's.
Over the years I have had too many disappointments with so called professional reviews.

Great service and location, being down the road from the Louvre, a very short stroll to the Seine, across the bridge from the Italian section.
The staff were good behaving.
Its s fun app, but i cant really use it :(
Thank you!
I installed thiamine app 20 minutes ago and haven't stopped playing yet....
The check-in clerk was super friendly!
It is not working on Windows 8 however I clicked it many times
No Chromecast support , mandatory adverts.
good time consumer.
It is a really awesome good game.
a action pack/ adventure hardcore zombie killing game
great game and the best game too
Keeps saying ""17/06/2014 16:09:43 : Exception - Can't Identify OS version""
Please make this game for mac!
Also, couldn't figure out the temperature control to make the room cooler.
DJä-MIXXER is very nice
Stay at this hotel Monday thru to Friday and what a find, a welcome drink on arrival set this stay of to a great start.
The location is fantastic, and the hotel services speak for themselves.
provide a app that can work on Samsung smart TV nor on Chromecast would have given one, but there are some nice series available.
The minute it starts to boot up, it crashes, every time.
